turnkey-nextcloud-18.0 (1) turnkey; urgency=low

  * Updated Nextcloud to latest upstream version - 27.1.1

    PHP). Closes #1691. It can be used to run the Nextcloud updater, like
    this::

        turnkey-php nextcloud/updater/updater.phar

  * Improve Nextcloud password setting. Specifically note that password
    requires 10 chars. Also ensure that failed password (when preseeded)
    doesn't make firstboot hang. Note if invalid pass is preseeded, then user
    will need to re-run turnkey-init interactively. Closes #1773 & #1838.

    - Refactor network interface code to ensure that it works as expected and
      supports more possible network config (e.g. hotplug interfaces & wifi).
    - Show error message rather than stacktrace when window resized to
      incompatable resolution - closes  #1609.
      [ Stefan Davis <stefan@turnkeylinux.org> ]
    - Bugfix exception when quitting configuration of mail relay.
      [ Oleh Dmytrychenko <dmytrychenko.oleh@gmail.com> github: @NitrogenUA ]

      compliant.
      [Stefan Davis <stefan@turnkeylinux.org> & Jeremy Davis

  * Firstboot Initialization (inithooks):
    - Refactor start up (now hooks into getty process, rather than having it's
      own service).
      [ Stefan Davis <stefan@turnkeylinux.org> ]
    - Refactor firstboot.d/01ipconfig (and 09hostname) to ensure that hostname
      is included in dhcp info when set via inithooks.
    - Package turnkey-make-ssl-cert script (from common overlay - now packaged
      as turnkey-ssl). Refactor relevant scripts to leverage turnkey-ssl.
    - Refactor run script - use bashisms and general tidying.
    - Show blacklisted password characters more nicely.
    - Misc packaging changes/improvements.

  * Security hardening & improvements:
    - Generate and use new TurnKey Bookworm keys.
    - Automate (and require) default pinning for packages from Debian
      backports. Also support non-free backports.

  * IPv6 support:
    - Adminer (only on LAMP based apps) listen on IPv6.
    - Nginx/NodeJS (NodeJS based apps only) listen on IPv6.

  * Misc bugfixes & feature implementations:
    - Remove rsyslog package (systemd journal now all that's needed).
